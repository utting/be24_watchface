# be24_watchface
A WearOS WatchFace with a single 24-hour hand, to help you live 'slow' and keep in touch with nature.

The watchface name Be24 is short for 'Besançon 24', because the first version of this watchface was written one Sunday when I was staying in Besanćon, FRANCE - a city famous for its watches.  It can also be thought of as a command: "Be [a] 24-hours person!"

The philosophy behind the watchface is to have a single 24-hour hand on the watch, which reflects the passage of the sun through the day, a bit like a sun-dial.  It also shows the daylight and night periods of your day (sunrise and sunset times are calculated from GPS location) to help keep you in touch with nature.  More broadly, the idea of having a watch that helps you to relax, worry less about each passing minute, live life in the moment, comes from the 'Slow' movement:
